Release v3.1.0: Critical Bug Fixes and New Endpoints
```

**In the DESCRIPTION field, copy and paste this:**

```markdown
## Summary

This release fixes **2 critical production bugs** and implements **5 new backend endpoints** for Settings and Account Management.

### üî¥ Critical Bug Fixes

1. **Fixed NameError Crash in Agent Endpoints**
   - `/agent/query` and `/agent/approve` crashed with `NameError: name 'graph' is not defined`
   - Added `graph = await initialize_graph(session)` to both endpoints
   - ‚úÖ Endpoints now work without crashing

2. **Fixed Stateful/Stateless Conflict**
   - Human-in-the-Loop approval workflow was broken
   - Replaced `MemorySaver` with `AsyncSqliteSaver` for persistent checkpoints
   - ‚úÖ Approval workflow now completes successfully

### ‚ú® New Features (5 Endpoints)

**Settings Management:**
- `GET /api/v1/settings` - Get user's constitution
- `POST /api/v1/settings` - Update scheduling preferences

**Account Management:**
- `GET /api/v1/auth/google/url` - Get OAuth URL
- `GET /api/v1/auth/accounts` - List connected accounts
- `DELETE /api/v1/auth/accounts/{id}` - Remove account

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Changes

- Enhanced `oauth_tokens` table with 4 new columns:
  - `account_email`, `status`, `connected_at`, `is_primary`

### üìö Documentation

- ‚úÖ Complete release notes: `docs/v3.1.0_RELEASE_NOTES.md`
- ‚úÖ Updated CHANGELOG.md
- ‚úÖ Updated README.md with new endpoints
- ‚úÖ Migration guide included

### üß™ Testing

- ‚úÖ Human-in-the-Loop workflow tested
- ‚úÖ All new endpoints tested with JWT
- ‚úÖ Checkpoint persistence verified
- ‚úÖ Multi-user concurrent access tested

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- Graph initialization is now async (`await initialize_graph()`)
- Checkpoints stored in `checkpoints.db` file (add to .gitignore)

### üì¶ Files Changed

- **Code:** 5 files modified (+509, -47 lines)
- **Docs:** 5 files updated/created (~1,700 lines)

3. **Click the dropdown arrow** next to the green button

**What you'll see:**

- The green button text changes to "Squash and merge"
- A description appears: "The 2 commits from this branch will be added to the base branch via a squash merge."

---

**Default content:**
- Title: "Release v3.1.0: Critical Bug Fixes and New Endpoints (#X)"
- Message: A concatenation of all your commit messages

2. **Edit the commit message** to be clean and concise:

**Replace the TITLE with:**
```

```

3. **Review the final message** - make sure it looks good

---

### Step 11: Confirm the Squash Merge

1. **Click the green "Confirm squash and merge" button**

**What happens:**
- GitHub performs the squash merge
- All 2 commits are squashed into 1 single commit
- The single commit is added to the `main` branch
- The pull request is automatically closed
- The branch is marked as merged

**You'll see:**
- A purple "Merged" badge at the top of the PR
- A message: "Username merged 2 commits into main from claude/clone-abp-agent-repo-011CUTMj7L4RuoUHQpUhKFNn"
- An option to delete the branch

---

### Step 12: Delete the Feature Branch (Optional but Recommended)

After successful merge:

1. You'll see a button: **"Delete branch"**
2. **Click "Delete branch"** to clean up

**Why delete?**
- ‚úÖ Keeps repository tidy
- ‚úÖ Prevents confusion about which branches are active
- ‚úÖ You can always restore it later if needed

**Don't worry:**
- The code is safely merged into main
- All commits are preserved in the squash commit
- You can still see the PR history

---

### Step 13: Verify the Merge

1. **Click on the "Code" tab** at the top (to go back to repository homepage)

2. **Check that you're on the main branch:**
   - Look at the branch selector (top left)
   - Should say "main"

3. **Look at the commit history:**
   - Click on the commit count (e.g., "234 commits")
   - The **first commit** should be your squash merge:
     - Title: "Release v3.1.0: Critical bug fixes and new endpoints"
     - Author: Your name
     - Date: Today

4. **Verify files are updated:**
   - Click on `README.md` - should show v3.1.0
   - Click on `CHANGELOG.md` - should have v3.1.0 section
   - Browse `src/main_refactored.py` - should have new endpoints at bottom

**Success!** ‚úÖ Your changes are now on main!

---

## What Just Happened?

### Before Squash Merge:
```
main: ... ‚Üí [old commits]

feature: ... ‚Üí [9920653] Fix bug ‚Üí [03e14de] Add docs
```

### After Squash Merge:
```
main: ... ‚Üí [old commits] ‚Üí [new-hash] Release v3.1.0 (squashed)
                                         ‚Üë
                                    Contains all changes
                                    from both commits
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Clean, single commit on main
- ‚úÖ Easy to revert if needed
- ‚úÖ Clear release in git history
- ‚úÖ All changes attributed to one logical unit

---

## Post-Merge: What to Do Next

### 1. Pull the Latest Main Locally (Optional)

If you want the changes on your local machine:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

You should see:
```
Updating <old-hash>...<new-hash>
Fast-forward
 10 files changed, 2212 insertions(+), 54 deletions(-)
```

---

### 2. Verify Deployment (Critical!)

**Start the application:**
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install any new dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

# Start the server
python -m src.main_refactored
```

**Test the health endpoint:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "database": "connected",
    "llm": "configured",
    "graph": "initialized"
  }
}
```

**If you see this ‚úÖ - The merge was successful!**

---

### 3. Test the Fixed Endpoints

**Test that /agent/query no longer crashes:**

```bash
# Create a test user first (if needed)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "testpass123",
    "internal_domain": "example.com"
  }'

# Test agent query (should NOT crash with NameError)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "<user-id-from-response-above>",
    "prompt": "How busy am I this week?"
  }'
```

**Expected:** JSON response (not an error!)

---

### 4. Test New Endpoints

**Get JWT token:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=test@example.com&password=testpass123"
```

**Test settings endpoint:**
```bash
# Save token from above
TOKEN="<your-token-here>"

curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/settings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "user_id": "...",
  "work_hours": { "start": "09:00", "end": "17:00", ... },
  "protected_time_blocks": [...],
  "scheduling_rules": {...}
}
```

**If you see this ‚úÖ - New endpoints work!**

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Can't create pull request"

**Possible reasons:**
- The branches are identical (nothing to merge)
- You don't have permission to create PRs
- The branch doesn't exist on GitHub

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify branch is pushed
git push origin claude/clone-abp-agent-repo-011CUTMj7L4RuoUHQpUhKFNn
```

---

### Issue: "Squash and merge" option is grayed out

**Possible reasons:**
- Repository settings disabled squash merging
- You need to be a repository admin

**Solution:**
- Use "Create a merge commit" instead, OR
- Ask repository owner to enable squash merging in Settings ‚Üí Options

---

### Issue: Merge conflicts

**What you'll see:**
- "This branch has conflicts that must be resolved"
- List of conflicting files

**Solution:**
1. Click "Resolve conflicts" button
2. GitHub will show conflict markers
3. Edit directly in browser to choose which version to keep
4. Click "Mark as resolved"
5. Click "Commit merge"
6. Then proceed with squash merge

**Most likely conflicts:**
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Keep both entries, v3.1.0 at top
- `README.md` - Use feature branch version

---

### Issue: Tests failing (if CI/CD is set up)

**What you'll see:**
- Red X next to "All checks have failed"

**Solution:**
1. Click "Details" to see why tests failed
2. Fix issues if needed
3. Push new commit to feature branch
4. Tests will re-run automatically

---
